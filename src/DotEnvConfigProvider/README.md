# Features

Loads environment variables from a .env file.
Integrates with Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration so .env values can be read like other config sources.
Lightweight, minimal dependencies.

## Contributions welcome

The parser is pretty dumb. You could immediately understand what it does at a glance.

# Why use it
If youâ€™re building a .NET app and want to:

- manage configuration via .env files (common in many ecosystems)
- avoid hardcoding sensitive values or spanning environment setup differences
- support local development setups easily

...then .Env.NET helps you do that cleanly within the .NET configuration framework.
